# Ben's Article Tracker
Deployed at https://brombaut.github.io/article-tracker/  
A simple tool I use to keep track of tech-related articles I have read and articles I would like to read.

## Future Work
Below is a list of features/functionality that I think would be worth implementing in the future:
- [x] Show dates, not epochs
- [x] Show last clicked date
- [ ] Click Count
- [ ] Stats (read vs unread, articles read this week, month, year, etc)
- [x] Cookie/local storage to stay signed in
- [ ] Tags on articles
- [x] Filter by Read/NotRead, not just sort
- [x] Number of articles in the table (pagination maybe?)
