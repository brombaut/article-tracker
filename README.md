# Ben's Article Tracker
Deployed at https://brombaut.github.io/article-tracker/  
A simple tool I use to keep track of tech-related articles I have read and articles I would like to read.

## Version 1 Tasks
Below is a list of features/functionality that I think would be worth implementing in the future:
- [x] Show dates, not epochs
- [x] Show last clicked date
- [x] Stats (read vs unread, articles read this week, month, year, etc)
- [x] Cookie/local storage to stay signed in
- [x] Filter by Read/Not Read, not just sort
- [x] Number of articles shown in the table (Pagination?)
- [x] Update font
- [x] 'Read Today' indicator
- [x] Automate scraping Title from actual article page
- [x] Add a 'N Minute Read' field, automate scraping that aswell
- [x] Refresh button - useful if I want to quickly hit the DB for any updates that I might have made on another computer
- [x] 'I'm feeling lucky' - Open random unread article button
- [ ] [LAST MAJOR FEATURE] Scrape tags on articles (include colours and link to dev.to tag. Clicking the tag takes you to the dev.to site with that taf filter applied) 

## Future Work
- [ ] Click Count
- [ ] Edit Records
- [ ] Filter on tags
